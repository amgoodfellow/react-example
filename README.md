# Basic React Example

## Purpose
This little example project was originally made to give coworkers an idea of how a very small React project looks.

It can be cloned down for some in-place editing, and it was heavily commented - more so than any project they'd normally see in our organization's codebase.

Over time, as more people have asked about React, I've decided to upload this project to GitHub just to refer people to

## Disclaimer
I'm by no means a React expert, and this tutorial might not be terribly up to date. I believe it was originally made some time in 2017 or early 2018, and I don't update it too consistently. The main point is to get a sense of how state and lifecycle methods wortk - and those things aren't likely to change much as time goes on.
