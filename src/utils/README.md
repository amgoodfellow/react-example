# Utility Folder

## Purpose

This folder is for utility methods or classes. Such things in the past have been parsers, or custum math functions. It's typically pretty rare to need such a function at all - let alone for several different files, so this folder is pretty rare. But if you ever have a class/function that isn't a UI component or a network requst, it should probably go in here.
