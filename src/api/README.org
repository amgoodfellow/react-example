* API Folder

** Purpose:
This folder is where all network requests should be kept. In most of our projects, we'll have a single =api.js= file that exports multiple network request functions. As an example, the file should contain functions of the following form:

#+begin_src javascript
  // Snooze a notification on the backend
  export const snooze = async id => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch('/notifications/v1/snooze/' + id, {
        credentials: 'include',
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          Accept: 'application/json',
          Authorization: 'Bearer ' + token
        }
      })
      return await response.json()
    } catch (err) {
      console.error(err)
      return err
    }
  }
#+end_src

Functions can then be imported from this file with the following syntax:

#+begin_src javascript
import { snooze } from './api.js'
#+end_src
