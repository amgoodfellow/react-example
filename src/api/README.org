* API Folder

** Purpose:
This folder is where all network requests should be kept. In most of our projects, we'll have a 
single =api.js= file that exports multiple network request functions. As an example, the file 
should contain functions of the following form:

#+begin_src javascript
  // All of these functions will be exported from the file (like public static functions)
  // The async keyword means that this function will execute asynchronously (in older JS we'd have
  // to deal with resolving promises. Now we can use the await keyword)
  // `id` is a param being passed to the function
  export const snooze = async id => {
    // If our HTTP request returns some sort of error code, it'll be caught and the error
    // will be returned to the calling function
    try {
      // This is a a fetch request. Read more about it at the link below:
      // developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch
      const response = await fetch('/notifications/v1/snooze/' + id, {
        credentials: 'include',
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          Accept: 'application/json',
          Authorization: 'Bearer ' + token
        }
      })
      return await response.json()
    } catch (err) {
      console.error(err)
      return err
    }
  }
#+end_src

Functions can then be imported from this file with the following syntax:

#+begin_src javascript
import { snooze } from './api.js'
#+end_src
